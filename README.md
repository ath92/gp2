This is the source (and even some compiled things) of my graduation project for the University of Twente, where I got my bachelors degree in Creative Technology. 

The project is meant to run on an interactive LED floor made by a company called LedGO, which consists of tiles with a resolution of 100x100px at 1x1cm per pixel. Each tile contains weight sensors at the corners, allowing for some interaction between what's visible and what happens on top that. While working on this project, I also used an installation with projectors and cameras at the University of Twente, which allowed for similar tracking of people walking on a floor display.

The software tracks individuals on the floor, and the visualizations respond to the behavior of the people walking around (or standing still).

A (short and rather unclear) of the floor in action can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=19&v=-8QXFW9XWkY.
